# Kwan‚Äôs Hierarchy of Product Needs

https://www.heavybit.com/library/blog/kwans-hierarchy-of-product-needs-the-four-levels-of-product-managers/


## Level 1: Shipping (PM) ‚õµ

* Managing sprints
* Writing specifications
* Communicating releases
* Making micro-tradeoffs

The most basic need that a PM satisfies is shipping features. At smaller
companies, your tech lead and/or your first PM will handle this need. At larger
companies a project manager may satisfy this need, especially when cross-product
features are involved. This involves day-to-day tackling of large and small
decisions that block the successful release of a new feature.

This can range from debating with design on the right feature specifics, to
testing some of those specifics with customer input. From communicating the
feature on a specification to engineering to working with engineering day-to-day
to ensure a successful release of the new feature. It involves informing
customers of the new release and managing the success metrics of the release.
Your PM is showing up at team standups, weighing in on JIRA and Invision (or
equivalent), and often participating in retros.


## Level 2: Planning (Senior PM) üöÇ

* Plan 3-5 month roadmaps
* Aligning stakeholders across engineering
* Design and marketing
* Motivating the team
* Challenge product-market fit
* Pricing and packaging
* Competitive analysis

The role of a more senior PM is to continually challenge product-market fit and
keep the team aligned on a 3-6 month, mid-term vision, of the product. This role
requires considerably more EQ on both the customer and the stakeholder
management front.

On the customer front, the PM needs to be able to creatively draw out real
customer needs. This survey and interview technique is more of an art than a
science, and comes with experience. The PM also needs to build the vision for
the product using multiple inputs, then rally your team on this vision. Major EQ
needed here. The vision needs to continue to drive product-market fit, and
adjustments are elegantly made along the way.

At small companies your PM at this level also handles the Shipping function.
When paired with a strong technical lead who can take on the burdens of
engineering team operations, this senior PM would more fully take on both
competitive analysis, and pricing and packaging decisions.


## Level 3: Strategic (Director to VP) ‚úàÔ∏è

* Product Vision Leadership (6 month - 2 year horizon)
* Product Portfolio Management - Making macro-tradeoffs between product areas
* Budgeting and Headcount
* Build vs. Buy recommendations
* Aligning senior stakeholders across sales, marketing, engineering, finance, and HR

At this stage of the company, you are taking off. You have product-market fit
and enough runway to survive 2-3 years. So it makes sense for your PM to start
visioning for the 2 year mark. Don‚Äôt confuse this with the overall company
vision, which is a BHAG (big hairy audacious goal) laid down by the founder that
can be as far out as 5-10 years. That company vision is meant to be a rally-cry,
blood-stirring, moonshot.

Your Strategic PM, usually director level or VP level, will take that company
vision, and lay out the pathways that pave your way towards that BHAG. This PM
will raise a debate on the validity of each of those pathways, and explore ways
to test and de-risk each. For example, a decision to use cloud or on-prem
deployment, to build vs. buy certain features within the product, or to invest
in a new product area to win market share. These decisions move the company down
a very different path, and rallying stakeholders through these decisions is what
your Strategic PM will do.


## Level 4: Strategic Partnering (CPO) üöÄ

* Fundraising and Board relations
* Winning key enterprise accounts
* New business lines, M&As
* Assessing Product bets
* Building an effective culture
* Organizational Design
* Product Vision Leadership (1 - 5 year horizon)

If you‚Äôre considering a full time CPO-only PM, meaning a PM dedicated to only
CPO level functions and not other earlier level functions, then your company is
likely experiencing rocketship growth. You‚Äôre looking to bolster your moat with
product bets while designing an organization that will sustain your growth.

Your CPO will help set and reinforce that culture for your product organization.
You might be courting very lucrative and strategic enterprise accounts beyond a
basic customer relationship. These can require roadmap commitments and
multi-year contracts. Your CPO needs to flank your VP Sales on customer visits
to tell the product story, close the deals and make sure you can deliver without
compromising your product strength in your market.

Partnerships from outside the company become important, and your CPO needs to
bring these opportunities to the table alongside your CEO and CFO. Your CPO will
take your BHAG moonshot and lay out the 5 year plan to it, identifying key
product holes that you must fill with product bets or M&A opportunities before
getting to the moon.

Finally, your CPO tells your powerful product story, for your board, for your
customers, for your team, and helps you keep the funding or revenue flowing.
