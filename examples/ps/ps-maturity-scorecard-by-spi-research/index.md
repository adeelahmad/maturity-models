## Service performance pillars

Successful PSOs use a model to benchmark, segment and analyze their organization into five distinct areas of performance, both logical and functional. Five service performance pillars form the foundation of all service-oriented organizations (responsible parties appear in parenthesis):

Vision, strategy and culture: (CEO) a unique view of the future and the role the service organization will play in shaping it.

Finance and operations: (CFO) the ability to manage services profit and loss — to generate revenue and profit while developing repeatable operating processes, IT applications and management controls.

Human capital alignment: (human resources) the ability to attract, hire, retain and motivate high-quality employees and subcontractors.

Service execution: (engagement/delivery staff) the methodologies, processes and tools to effectively schedule, deploy and measure the quality of the service delivery process.

Client relationships: (marketing and sales) the ability to communicate effectively with employees, partners and customers to generate and close business and win deals.


## Professional Service maturity levels

Five maturity levels help determine the relative operational effectiveness of each pillar:

Level 1 — Initiated “Heroic”:

* The PSO is in its early stages; operating processes are ad hoc and fluid.
* The business environment is chaotic and opportunistic, and the focus for the PSO is primarily new client acquisition and reference building.
* Employees wear many hats and serve many roles.
* The primary goal is growth.

Level 2 — Piloted “Functional Excellence”:

* Core operating processes have become repeatable.
* The company can demonstrate best practices in separate functional areas or geographies, but staff has not documented and codified them yet for the entire organization.

Level 3 — Deployed “Project Excellence”:

* The PSO has created a set of standard processes and operating principles for all major service performance pillars, but renegades and “hold-outs” may still exist.

Level 4 — Institutionalized “Portfolio Excellence”:

* Management uses precise measurements, metrics and controls, to effectively manage the PSO.
* Each service-performance pillar contains a detailed set of operating principles, tools and measurements, with quantitative and qualitative goals for specific functions.

Level 5 — Optimized “Collaborative”:

* The PSO focuses on continual improvement of all elements of the five performance pillars.
* A disciplined, controlled process is in place to measure and optimize performance through both incremental and innovative technological improvements.
* Management has established quantitative process-improvement objectives, and continually revises them to reflect changing business objectives, and uses them as criteria in managing process improvement.
