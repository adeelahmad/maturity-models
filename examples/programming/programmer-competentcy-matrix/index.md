## Code quality

Code organization within a file:

1. Methods are grouped logically or by accessibility

2. Code is grouped into regions and well commented with references to other source files

3. File has license header, summary, well commented, consistent white space usage. The file should look beautiful.

Code organization across files:

1. Related files are grouped into a folder

2. Each physical file has a unique purpose, for e.g. one class definition, one feature implementation etc.

3. Code organization at a physical level closely matches design and looking at file names and folder distribution provides insights into design

Source tree organization:

1. Basic separation of code into logical folders.

2. No circular dependencies, binaries, libs, docs, builds, third-party code all organized into appropriate folders

3. Physical layout of source tree matches logical hierarchy and organization. The directory names and organization provide insights into the design of the system.

Code readability:

1. Good names for files, variables classes, methods etc.

2. No long functions, comments explaining unusual code, bug fixes, code assumptions

3. Code assumptions are verified using asserts, code flows naturally &#8211; no deep nesting of conditionals or methods

Defensive coding:

1. Checks arguments and asserts critical assumptions in code

2. Makes sure to check return values and check for exceptions around code that can fail.

3. Has his own library to help with defensive coding, writes unit tests that simulate faults

Error handling:

1. Basic error handling around code that can throw exceptions/generate errors

2. Ensures that error/exceptions leave program in good state, resources, connections and memory is all cleaned up properly

3. Codes to detect possible exception before, maintain consistent exception handling strategy in all layers of code, come up with guidelines on exception handling for entire system.
